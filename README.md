Data Description

The marketing dataset used in this project contains the following features:
Lead Source: The source from which the lead was generated.
Converted: Whether the lead was converted into a paying customer or not (1 for converted, 0 for not converted).
TotalVisits: Total number of visits made by the lead on the website.
Time Spent: Total time spent by the lead on the website.
Page Views: Total number of pages viewed by the lead on the website.
Specialization: The industry domain in which the lead is interested.
What is your current occupation: The occupation of the lead.
City: The city from which the lead is.
A free copy of Mastering The Interview: Whether the lead had opted for a free copy of the course material.

Data Analysis Results

The data analysis performed on the marketing dataset yielded the following insights:
The overall conversion rate is 38.54%.
The highest number of leads are generated from the Google search engine, followed by direct traffic and organic search.
Leads who have visited the website more than 10 times are more likely to convert than those who visited less.
Leads who spent more than 300 seconds on the website are more likely to convert than those who spent less.
Leads who viewed more than 3 pages on the website are more likely to convert than those who viewed less.
The Specialization feature has a significant impact on the conversion rate. Leads who are interested in certain specializations are more likely to convert than those who are not.
The What is your current occupation feature also has a significant impact on the conversion rate. Working professionals are more likely to convert than those who are unemployed or students.
The City feature does not have a significant impact on the conversion rate.
The majority of leads do not opt for a free copy of the course material.

Conclusion

The data analysis performed on the marketing dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that affect lead conversion rates. The results suggest that lead behaviour on the website, their interests and occupation, are important factors to consider when designing marketing strategies to improve the conversion rate. This project can be useful for companies in the online education industry in making informed decisions about their marketing campaigns and lead management.
